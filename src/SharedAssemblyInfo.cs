// Haven's scheme: Major.Minor.Build.Revision, where Revision == 0 marks a public release
// (IsPublicRelease) and the displayed VersionNumber drops the trailing .0. The community
// fork is branded by name ("Community Edition" in the title / About), not by the version
// number, so these stay purely numeric and Haven-consistent. CE shows the full 4-part
// string (Singletons.MetadataInfo), so this displays as "0.5.7.1". Revision 1 (like the
// prior 0.5.6.1 release) means IsPublicRelease is false - that only gates a commented-out
// beta-features block, matching how every "Public Update x.y.z.1" build has shipped.
